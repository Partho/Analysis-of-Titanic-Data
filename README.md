# Analysis-of-Titanic-Data

A tragic event which occured on April 15, 1912, makes us wonder what factors led to such loss of life, or what groups of people were more likely to survive than others. I have tried to analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive, as in, whether women were more likely to survive than men (preference given due to cultural norms), or whether upper-class people had higher survival rate than commoners, etc.
